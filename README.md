## Description
Hey, We have created an awesome martial arts gym website. It's super easy to use â€“ you can learn all about our gym, get to know our amazing masters, and see all our classes on a handy calendar. Signing up for classes is a breeze, and you can even add them to your Google Calendar straight from the site. It's perfect for keeping your training schedule organized.

## Features
- A fully functional header, with self-explanitory buttons that link you to the different section of the site for ease of use.
- A short, looped clip of the first Avenger himself, Captain America, displaying some of the techniques taught by our Karate Masters
- Short Bio's of our individual Karate Masters and the Avengers they embody.
- A short mission statement and our Dojo's motto
- A contact area that includes the ways we can be reached that includes our address and location on a google map.
- Lastly, but certainly not least, an awesome styling designed with CSS that really attracts like minded future Avengers!
